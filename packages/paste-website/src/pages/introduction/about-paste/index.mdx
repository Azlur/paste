## Twilio UX Principles

These principles are statements of how I work, how you work, how we work as a UX organisation. We hold ourselves accountable to the behaviours and practices for which they advocate. We challenge our work to meet the standards they call for.

### How we work

#### Think big and take small steps

Work methodically towards a compelling vision. Be willing to iterate your work as you build an understanding of customer needs, capturing the vision as you adjust and progress.

#### Start with the customer

Understand the customer, their problem, and the context first. Begin by conducting or seeking out the customer research that will enable you to create a compelling solution.

#### Seek feedback early and often

Share work while it’s still scrappy to shape its direction. Collaborate with other disciplines to expose different ideas that challenge your thinking and strengthen your work as it evolves.

#### Validate work with customer testing

Invite real customers to test and challenge solutions. Gather robust feedback and iterate your work until it both solves the customer problem and improves the overall product experience.

#### Shepherd work all the way to the customer

Take responsibility for every detail that’s delivered to the customer. Share the work’s intent with your team and ensure that its implementation is true to the vision.

### How we build

#### Develop a seamless experience

Create customer experiences that are unified in look and feel. Make the transitions between business units unnoticeable with consistent use of styles, patterns, and interactions.

#### Refine to the essentials

Choose every element with a clear purpose that’s attached to a customer need. Refine the experience until every component is essential in solving the customer problem.

#### Set the bar higher

Meet the high standard that’s expected, then push past it. Elevate function, form, language, and design to ensure that the quality of the experience raises the bar for future work.

#### Recognize the diversity of every user

Understand that our users are not all like us. Work with empathy and consideration, offering guidance and encouragement to create an inclusive experience.

## Design System Principles

The Design Systems team won't ship anything unless:

### It's Inclusive

We build a floor for every experience at Twilio. It’s crucial that we consider the voices of people who don’t look like us, speak different languages, work in different parts of the world, or use our work in different ways.

### It's a Multiplier

We don’t work on something unless its a base common denominator for a number of exceptional experiences. Our work should multiply upstream and downstream efforts.

### It's Referenceable

Systems should never have single points of failure. Good documentation, reliable APIs, and an intuitive language of operation are necessary to ensure that what we do works, and works well.

      Paste components don't support a className property, why is that?
    </DisclosureHeading>
    <DisclosureContent>
      <Paragraph>
        Whilst we are acutely aware that a Design System cannot do and hold everything that is needed for each
        individual product, and that extension and customization is the key to a successful Design System at scale, we
        will not be providing that functionality via a custom classname.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>We won't be doing this for a number of reasons:</Paragraph>
      <UnorderedList>
        <ListItem>
          Global classnames, especially overrides, impact the confidence teams can have on the state of their styling.
          There is no guarantee you won't affect someone else or they won't affect you, impacting the success of
          independent teams and confidence in your deployments. This particularly applies to a number of Twilio products
          that are multi-tenant UI, where multiple independent teams are providing UI to a single page

        <ListItem>Uncontrolled customization causes design fragmentation</ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Uncontrolled customization impacts the ability of the Design System team to push changes to and evolve the
          Design System, without adversely impacting downstream consumers
        </ListItem>
      </UnorderedList>
      <Paragraph>
        Above all, custom classnames erode trust in the system, the components, the product and adversely affect the
        trust of the customer.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Customization and extension will be provided, but it will be provided via a controlled API, within the
        constraints of the Design System. More on that soon.

      Why does Paste use @twilio-paste/uid-library to generate ids? Why don't you use static ids?
    </DisclosureHeading>
    <DisclosureContent>
      <Paragraph>
        ID references in a web page must be unique for them to work correctly, especially when supporting assistive
        technologies such as screen readers. In a multi tenant, single page application you do not always have control
        of what is loaded into a webpage at any one time. As a result static ids can clash and cause duplicates.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        To guarantee that every id in a web page is unique, regardless of what was loaded on the page and in what order,
        we use this library to generate ids for us.

      OK, so you don't support classNames or static IDs, how do I create DOM references for my tests?

      <Paragraph>We recommend using data attributes for your test identifiers.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        All Paste components should support adding global HTML attributes as part of their API. So applying something
        like <InlineCode>data-testid="foo"</InlineCode> directly to the component should work.

      What testing is done on Paste components?
    </DisclosureHeading>
    <DisclosureContent>
      <Paragraph>
        We use Jest coupled with Enzyme for older components and React-Testing-Library for newer components to do
        component unit testing. We're transitioning away from Enzyme to React-Testing-Library in the long term as it is
        now the recommended testing library of the React team. We aim for 85-90% test coverage.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        We use Applitools for visual regression testing. We test each component, variant and state (where possible)
        separately. We only run them through Chrome currently.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        We also use Chromatic for UI review where any visual changes are reviewed by a designer for all components.
